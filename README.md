# commands i often forget about.

(and some i should use more often)

<hr />

### `cat [filename]` : print contents of a file

### `code .` open VSCode from the current directory

### `which [filename]` : print pathnames for given files

### `fuck [--yeah]` : [cool cli](https://github.com/nvbn/thefuck) that fixes previous console command (thanks ronak)
